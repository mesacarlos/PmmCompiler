# Pmm
Pmm is the name for the programming language created for the DLP (Programming Languages Design) course. This language compiles to MAPL, a stack-based language for educational purposes.
You can find a working .jar file [here](https://github.com/mesacarlos/PmmCompiler/releases) along with examples if you want to test it out.
